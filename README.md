# POKE-ME 
Do you ever wonder how tall a pokemon is in real life? Or are you planning on battling with someone and want to find out the movesets of your opponent's pokemon? If you are, **Poke-Me** is perfect for users like you! 

### Project Overview 
**Poke-Me** is created for users to easily search and find basic information about a specific pokemon. It is modeled after the *Pokedex* that users can find inside the Pokemon game. A *Pokedex* is a directory containing multiple details about the pokemon; i.e. their height, weight, attack moves and etc. 
Using the PokemonAPI ([click here for the link to the PokemonAPI!](https://pokeapi.co/)), **Poke-Me** fetches data and uses DOM manipulation to display the relevant information about a pokemon's profile. The specific type of information shown upon search is described further in details below. 

### Basic Layout
**Poke-Me** will include a search and find function located at the header of the page. Upon entering a pokemon's name, the site will display the pokemon's name and picture on the left side of the page. A feature that was added to the pokemon's picture was to show the picture of the front-facing side of the pokemon when a user hovers over the picture. On the right side of the page, the searched pokemon's biological data, basic statistics and special abilities used by that pokemon. 

Biological data will include: 
*Type of pokemon 
*Height of pokemon
*Weight of pokemon

Basic statistics will include:
*Hp of pokemond
*Attack of pokemond
*Defense of pokemon
*Special-attack of pokemon
*Special-defense of pokemon
*Speed of pokemon
